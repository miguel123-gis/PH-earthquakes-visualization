### Simple visualization of earthquakes in the Philippines from July 2011 to April 2021 recorded by www.emsc-csem.org

Unfortunately, the imageio library cannot be imported in Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/miguel123-gis/PH-earthquakes-visualization/master) so you need to download the whole repo and launch the Jupyter Notebook from your devise. The notebook on BInder still works, it's just that the exported images won't be converted into video in the notebook because imageio can't be imported. So you need to convert the pictures into video outside the notebook.
